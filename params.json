This tool was created to bridge the gap on tools for label printing on the linux platform. \r\n\r\nThe tool currently accepts 8-bit black/white BMP files and can print them on the Bixolon SLP-T400. Tool currently has a commandline as well as a basic GUI. The commands to execute the tool can be found below.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n```\r\n\r\n        ./main.py <label-file> <width-mm> <height-mm> <horizontal-gap-mm> <vertical-gap-mm> <labels-per-row> <paper-width-mm> <lable-count> [<printer-port>]\r\n        \r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n        \r\n        1) label-file         : Path to the label file. Must be a black and white 8-bit per pixel BMP file\r\n        2) width-mm           : Width of the label in mm\r\n        3) height-mm          : Height of the label in mm\r\n        4) horizontal-gap-mm  : Horizontal gap between two adjacent labels in mm\r\n        5) vertical-gap-mm    : Vertical gap between two adjacent labels in mm\r\n        6) labels-per-row     : Number of labels per row on the paper.\r\n        7) paper-width-mm     : Width of the label paper in mm\r\n        8) label-x-offset-mm  : Horizontal offset in mm\r\n        9) layel-y-offset-mm  : Vertical offset in mm\r\n        10) label-count       : Number of lables to print\r\n        11) printer-port      : [Optional] printer device path [eg: /dev/usb/lp0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo Run UI\r\n```\r\n        ./run-ui.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TODO List\r\n\r\n - [x] Create basic utility\r\n - [x] Fix bug in printing 2 labels when 3 labels are in a row\r\n - [x] Create Base64 image decoder module\r\n - [x] Create http server to support printing via web\r\n - [x] Create tool operator page to send commands to the http server\r\n - [x] Create GUI \r\n - [ ] Create standalone linux executable - work in progress\r\n - [ ] Support png and jpeg image types\r\n - [ ] Create label designer\r\n - [ ] Create support for other printer models\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRavith Botejue (@ravithb) Since January 2016\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you find any issues with the tool please drop a comment on our github page or log an issue.","google":"UA-74872392-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
